The EXISTS operator is used in a WHERE clause to check whether a subquery returns any rows.

The EXISTS operator evaluates to TRUE if the subquery returns at least one row, and FALSE otherwise.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE EXISTS (subquery); 

--- The following SQL checks if any suppliers has a product with a price lower than 10. If the subquery evaluates to TRUE; list the suppliers with a product price less than 10:
SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT ProductName
  FROM Products
  WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 10
);
